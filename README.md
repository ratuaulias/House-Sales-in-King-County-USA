# House-Sales-in-King-County-USA

As a Data Analyst for a Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) that aims to invest in residential real estate. The primary task is to determine the market price of houses based on a set of features. By analyzing and predicting housing prices, I will assist the REIT in making informed investment decisions. The project revolves around a dataset that contains house sale prices for King County, which includes Seattle. The dataset covers the period between May 2014 and May 2015. The original dataset was obtained from a reliable source and has been slightly modified for the purposes of this project.

The project is divided into ten questions, and I will complete using Python programming language. Throughout the project, I will work with various attributes or features of the houses, such as square footage, number of bedrooms, number of floors, and more. By analyzing these features and their relationship with the sale prices, I will build models to predict the market price of houses based on given attributes.
